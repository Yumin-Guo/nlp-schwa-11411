      "Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in Peppy next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to Peppy terms. After Valentin learns to Zimmer dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all Zimmer auctioned effects, Zimmer returns in despair to Zimmer burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun Peppy only wanted to help Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. They embrace and Valentin tells Peppy it's no use; no one wants to hear Valentin speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let They make a musical together.\n",

      "Now the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?\" Valentin, in Valentin only audible line, replies \"With pleasure!\" revealing Valentin French accent. The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as the film crew prepare to shoot another take.\n",
